# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jun 20, 2022 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Build the basic todo App using React and javascript.

**Thoughts:** I got stuck in between about the two way flow in react and able to manage it. And npm start is not working to start the react application and getting react-script error. But I code the app in codesandbox and later I will move it to locally and push it to github.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
